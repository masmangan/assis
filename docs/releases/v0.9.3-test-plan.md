# ASSIS v0.9.3 – Test Plan

> Status: Draft  
> Baseline: ASSIS v0.9.3  
> Last updated: 2026-01-07

This document describes the **manual test plan** for ASSIS v0.9.3.
It focuses on *evidence-based execution* rather than feature validation.

This plan is intentionally pragmatic and scoped to validate that ASSIS can be
executed, produces artifacts, and behaves consistently across real-world code bases.

---

## 1. Test Objectives

The objectives of this test plan are to:

- Validate that ASSIS CLI can be executed independently of an IDE
- Generate UML diagrams from typical Java repositories
- Collect **hard evidence** (logs, screen recordings, artifacts)
- Identify blocking failures and unexpected behavior
- Establish a reproducible baseline for future releases

This is **not** a feature-completeness test.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- ASSIS CLI execution using the released v0.9.3(-beta) JAR
- Diagram generation from selected Java repositories
- Logging, diagnostics, and exit behavior
- PlantUML rendering sanity checks
- Handling of large and diverse code bases

### Out of scope

- Feature validation or correctness proofs
- Performance benchmarking
- Static analysis cleanup (Sonar, CodeQL)
- Exhaustive test coverage
- IDE plugin testing

---

## 3. Test Evidence Strategy

Each test execution should produce:

- A **screen recording** (Zoom, Quicktime or similar tool) showing:
  - `assis --version`
  - command-line execution
  - diagram rendering
- Captured **logger outputs**
- Generated `.puml` files (compressed as `.zip`)
- Timing and basic repository statistics

Artifacts are uploaded as:
- GitHub Release assets (preferred for large files)
- Or linked from GitHub Issues if small

---

## 4. Stop Conditions

Stop the test plan execution immediately if:

- ASSIS cannot render ASSIS itself
- ASSIS fails to start or crashes on a minimal input
- Reproducible fatal errors occur early in execution
- Output artifacts are not generated

When stopping:
- Record logs and video evidence
- Open a GitHub Issue describing the failure
- Reference this test plan and the execution issue

---

## 5. Test Environment

Record for each test:

- ASSIS version (`--version`)

Tests should be executed using:

```bash
java -jar assis-cli-0.9.3-beta.jar
```

---

## 6. Standard Test Procedure

For each repository:

1. Clone repository using shallow clone:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 <repo-url>
   ```

2. Capture version information:
   ```bash
   java -jar assis-cli-0.9.3-beta.jar --version
   ```

3. Run ASSIS:
   ```bash
   java -jar assis-cli-0.9.3-beta.jar
   ```

4. Capture:
   - wall-clock time
   - logs
   - generated diagrams

5. Open at least one `.puml` file in:
   - PlantUML Eclipse plugin, 
   - Jebbs VS Code extension, or
   - PlantUML online server

6. Record observations and warnings

## 7. Test Repositories

Planned repositories include:

- ASSIS repository (dogfooding)
- Spring Petclinic
- Sedgewick & Wayne examples
- Horstmann examples
- Deitel & Deitel examples

## 8. Data to Record

For each test run, record:

- Repository name and commit hash
- Repository size (files, Java files)
- Execution time
- Number and size of generated `.puml` files
- Warnings and errors
- Rendering success (yes/no)

---

## 9. Reporting

### Execution tracking

- Open a GitHub Issue titled:
  **"Execute v0.9.3 test plan"**
- Use the issue to track progress, deviations, and links to artifacts

### Final report

After completion (or stop):

- Create `docs/releases/v0.9.3-test-report.md`
- Summarize results, failures, and lessons learned
- Link to execution issue, videos, and artifacts

---

## 10. Notes

- Sonar coverage reports are informational only
- Coverage deltas may be confusing; record both overall and new-code metrics
- Environmental quirks (IDE refresh, dark mode screenshots, etc.) should be noted
